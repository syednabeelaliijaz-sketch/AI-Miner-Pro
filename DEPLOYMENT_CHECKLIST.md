3. [ ] Sign up at railway.app with GitHub
4. [ ] Deploy from GitHub repo
5. [ ] Add environment variables
6. [ ] Bot should start automatically

### Render
1. [ ] Create GitHub repository
2. [ ] Sign up at render.com
3. [ ] Create Background Worker
4. [ ] Connect GitHub repo
5. [ ] Set build/start commands
6. [ ] Add environment variables

### Heroku
1. [ ] Install Heroku CLI
2. [ ] Create Heroku app
3. [ ] Set environment variables
4. [ ] Deploy via git
5. [ ] Scale worker to 1

## After Deployment

### âœ… Testing
- [ ] Check deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Test bot with /start command
- [ ] Test admin commands with /admin
- [ ] Verify database is working
- [ ] Test mining activation
- [ ] Test wallet features

### âœ… Monitoring
- [ ] Check bot is responding
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Set up log monitoring
- [ ] Test automated profit calculation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Bot not responding**: Check bot token and environment variables
- **Database errors**: Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- **Import errors**: Check all dependencies in requirements.txt
- **Permission errors**: Verify admin user IDs are correct

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check logs (Railway/Render)
View logs in dashboard

# Check environment variables
echo $BOT_TOKEN

# Test database connection
python -c "from database.database import db_manager; print('DB OK')"
```

## Success Indicators

When deployment is successful, you should see in logs:
```
INFO - Starting USDT Mining Bot...
INFO - Bot username: @your_bot_username
INFO - Database initialized successfully
INFO - Profit scheduler started successfully
INFO - Bot post-initialization completed
```

## Free Tier Limitations

### Railway
- 500 hours/month free
- $5 credit monthly
- Sleeps after 30 min inactivity

### Render
- 750 hours/month free
- Sleeps after 15 min inactivity
- Slower cold starts

### Heroku
- 550-1000 hours/month
- Sleeps after 30 min inactivity
- Requires credit card for verification

### PythonAnywhere
- Always-on tasks available
- Limited CPU seconds
- Good for small bots

## Keeping Bot Alive

For platforms that sleep (Railway, Render, Heroku):

1. **Use UptimeRobot** (free):
   - Create account at uptimerobot.com
   - Add HTTP monitor for your bot's health endpoint
   - Pings every 5 minutes to keep alive

2. **Create Health Endpoint** (already included in bot):
   - Bot responds to health checks
   - Prevents sleeping

## Scaling Up

When you outgrow free tiers:
- Railway: $5/month for more hours
- Render: $7/month for always-on
- DigitalOcean: $5/month VPS
- AWS/GCP: Pay-as-you-use
